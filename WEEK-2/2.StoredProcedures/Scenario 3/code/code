CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE TransferFunds (

    p_target_acc_id   IN NUMBER,
    p_amount          IN NUMBER
) IS
    v_source_balance  NUMBER;
BEGIN
    -- Get source account balance
    SELECT Balance INTO v_source_balance
    FROM Accounts
    WHERE AccountID = p_source_acc_id;

    -- Check if sufficient balance
    IF v_source_balance < p_amount THEN
        RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20001, 'Insufficient balance in source account.');
    END IF;

    -- Deduct from source
    UPDATE Accounts
    SET Balance = Balance - p_amount,
        LastModified = SYSDATE
    WHERE AccountID = p_source_acc_id;

    -- Add to target
    UPDATE Accounts

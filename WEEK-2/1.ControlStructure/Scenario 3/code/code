    FOR i IN (
        SELECT l.LoanID, c.Name, l.EndDate
        FROM Loans l
        JOIN Customers c ON l.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
        WHERE l.EndDate BETWEEN SYSDATE AND SYSDATE + 30
    ) LOOP
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(
            'Reminder: Loan ID ' || i.LoanID ||
            ' for customer ' || i.Name ||
            ' is due on ' || TO_CHAR(i.EndDate, 'DD-Mon-YYYY')
        );

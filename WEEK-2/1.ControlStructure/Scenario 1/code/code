Scenario 1: The bank wants to apply a discount to loan interest rates for customers above 60 years old.
o	Question: Write a PL/SQL block that loops through all customers, checks their age, and if they are above 60, apply a 1% discount to their current loan interest rates.




BEGIN
    FOR i IN (SELECT CustomerID, DOB FROM Customers) LOOP
        IF MONTHS_BETWEEN(SYSDATE, i.DOB) / 12 > 60 THEN
            UPDATE Loans
            SET InterestRate = InterestRate - 1
            WHERE CustomerID = i.CustomerID;
        END IF;
    END LOOP;

    COMMIT;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('1% discount applied to customers above 60.');
END;
